# python-brm
### It's just one more BRM in Python.

## Prerequisits:
======
1. This BRM engine dosn't have actions. 
2. Rules applied one by one (sequencially) to the scalar(s), vector(s), matrix(s) or tensor(s) level and return 0 (false) or 1 (true)
3. Rules functions may have more then one argument (it can be scalar, vector, matrix or tensor)
4. All elements ( function, scalar, vector, matrix or tensor) of BRM engine are symbolic and symbolic 
5. Symbolic logical(boolean) and mathematical operations applied on top of all elements (function, scalar, vector, matrix or tensor)
6. Result of this BRM  operation the scalar value 0(false)/1...n  where n how many rules a completed on vectors,matrix or tensors  level 
7. Library used: 
!["Theano symbolic library"](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano
"Theano is best from the best. Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano features:
tight integration with NumPy – Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions.
transparent use of a GPU – Perform data-intensive computations much faster than on a CPU.
efficient symbolic differentiation – Theano does your derivatives for functions with one or many inputs.
speed and stability optimizations – Get the right answer for log(1+x) even when x is really tiny.
dynamic C code generation – Evaluate expressions faster.
extensive unit-testing and self-verification – Detect and diagnose many types of errors.")

Solution wrapped as Visual Studio project.
##  Conclusion:
This BRM engine is perfect tool (goal function) for optimal scenarious required to find best set arrangement of vector, matrix , tensor
